I have created a Django project that showcases various functionalities and concepts in Django Rest Framework (DRF). 
The project includes function-based views, class-based views, and generic views for handling different endpoints. 
I used serializers and nested serializers to manage data representation, along with viewsets and routers (including nested routers) 
for streamlined URL routing. The project supports filtering, searching, and sorting, and features cart management (creation, retrieval, deletion),
multiple image uploads, CRUD operations on cart items, JWT authentication using Djoser, order processing, and payment integration with Flutterwave.
